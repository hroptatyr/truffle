truffle is a command line tool to roll over futures contracts according
to some specified roll-over schema.  The focus is clearly on batch
processing and speed.

As features we can state:
+ gravitational roll-over, i.e. stateless mode of operation, no
  initial portfolio has to be specified
+ support to apply a roll-over schema to time series
+ support to roll over volume and open interest data
+ support for forward contracts and their cash flows

Schema files state roll-over dates relative to a calendric year and are
given in a sparse form that resembles polygon definitions, as pairs of
dates and exposure values.  Each line in the schema file looks like:

MY  DATE VALUE  DATE VALUE  [...]

where MY is the contract specifier and a year offset, e.g. F0 is this
year's January contract.  F1 is next year's January contract, etc.

For example schema files take a look at the test/ directory.
