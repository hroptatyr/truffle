/*
 * Portable coroutines for C. Caveats:
 *
 * 1. You should not take the address of a stack variable, since stack management
 *    could reallocate the stack, the new stack would reference a variable in the
 *    old stack. Also, cloning a coroutine would cause the cloned coroutine to
 *    reference a variable in the other stack.
 * 2. You must call coro_init for each kernel thread, since there are thread-local
 *    data structures. This will eventually be exploited to scale coroutines across
 *    CPUs.
 * 3. If setjmp/longjmp inspect the jmp_buf structure before executing a jump, this
 *    library probably will not work.
